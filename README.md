## About

<img alt="Screenshot" src="./screenshot.gif" width="60%" height="auto">

This game was built as my grade 11 computer programing final project. The grading was based on demonstrating different programing structures such as ifs, loops, etc... I chose to build a simple RPG.

Castles and Wizards is a game engine that reads pre-made text files to create its enviroment including: chests, conversations & maps. Configuration files & maps can be found inside `/Objects/...`. 

The game comes with a basic map editor to aid in building maps quickly. Maps are named using coordinates to create a tiled world map (`00.txt` is spawn).

### Controls
- `WASD` to move
- `Space` to interact.
